Extended COCO API (excocotools)


COCO has become a standard annotation format for person keypoint detection.
Our Extended COCO API is developed based on [@cocodataset/cocoapi](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi).
Our excocotools aims to support multiple human pose-related datasets, including COCO, [CrowdPose](https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/CrowdPose) and so on.

We provide a simple [demo](PythonAPI/demo_crowdpose.py) to evaluate on CrowdPose dataset.

To install:
-run "sh install.sh" under coco/PythonAPI
