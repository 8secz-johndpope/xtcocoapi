Extended COCO API (xtcocotools)


COCO has become a standard annotation format for the task of person keypoint detection, and is widely used for multiple datasets.
Our Extended COCO API is developed based on [@cocodataset/cocoapi](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi). 

We aim to provide a unified evaluation tools to support multiple human pose-related datasets, including COCO, [CrowdPose](https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/CrowdPose) and so on.

We provide a simple [demo](demo_crowdpose.py) to evaluate on CrowdPose dataset.
